### Description

This is my third project. In my first project, [An Arithmetic Arranger](https://github.com/wswalker87/fcc_arithmetic_arranger) I used a lot of inline comments. These are meant for me as I get further into my python learning. With this second project I will keeping more comments in this README.

For my second project, [A Time Calculator](https://github.com/wswalker87/fcc_time_calc), I actually used more MD int he readme and that one drove me nuts.

I am going to **Try** to be a bit more "pythonic" with this one. My goal is to add some of my own unit testing.

This will be a big one because I am still slightly askew regarding classes in python. I am also going to begin using docstrings.
